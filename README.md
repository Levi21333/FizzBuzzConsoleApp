# FizzBuzzConsoleApp

The Console App is above and written in Java. I used Eclipse as my IDE and it works properly as I checked the work from testing it until I have my expected results.
"#" is for any number that is not a multiple of 3 or 5, Fizz is for only mulitples of 3, Buzz is for only muliples of 5, and FizzBuzz is for a multiple of 3 and 5.
